# Publish-Me---Release-Assistant
The purpose of this project is to take published books sales data, sorted it by sub-genre to allow self-publish authors to determine the highest probability for successful sales of their novel based on genre and sub-genre sales data. 

The long term goal would be to design an application or web based dashboard that will allow the author search or filter for the chosen sub-genre/tropes for sales numbers for historical sales data. Furthermore, to cross check with planned release dates of similar books that will be published by traditional publishing houses to prevent lower sales by releasing self-published books at or around the same time of more well known or popular authors.
